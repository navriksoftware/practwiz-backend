  Rahul, with 22 years of experience in handling HR initiatives for large Indian brands, joined Capable Hardware Systems in 2023 as an HR Business Manager, reporting to the HR Head, Vinod Dua. While Rahul was excited about the opportunity, he started to feel isolated within a month of joining due to internal team dynamics.
  
  Rahul was expecting Vinod to announce a new structure where Shantanu would report to him. However, Vinod retained the existing structure, fearing resistance from Shantanu, who was an old-timer. This led to conflicts, with Shantanu obstructing Rahul's initiatives, withholding information, and influencing others against Rahul.
  
  The situation created a negative team atmosphere, making Rahul question whether he should continue in the organization.`,

    title: "DESIGNING A CUSTOMER RETENTION PLAN",
    content: `Glenn DeSouza is President of Strategic Quality Systems Inc., a consulting firm based in Belmont, Massachusetts. He is also a Visiting Assistant Professor at the University of Massachusetts at Boston.
This article emphasizes the need to develop a customer retention plan. It provides a simple four-step process to design a customer retention strategy, suggests a classification for 'type of defector' and emphasizes the need for benchmarking demonstrated best practice to identify ways to build switching costs and develop approaches to yield higher levels of customer retention.

Nothing may seem more obvious than the need to keep customers coming back. Yet, customer retention is either overlooked or devalued when it comes to strategy development. Any marketing manager can provide you with a market share estimate, but ask for the customer retention rate and you may well get a blank stare.
Buck Rodgers, who headed worldwide marketing for IBM as the company's sales grew from $10 billion to $50 billion, speaks forcefully about the importance of customer retention in his book, The IBM Way: "It seems to me," observes Rodgers, "that most companies are a lot better at prospecting for new customers than maintaining their customer list. As far as I'm concerned, customer maintenance is imperative to doing business... Someone once said I behaved as if every IBM customer were on the verge of leaving and that I'd do anything to keep them from bolting."

It pays to be obsessive about retaining customers. A cost study of service companies by Bain & Co. found that customer retention has a more powerful effect on profits than market share, scale economies, and other variables that are commonly associated with competitive advantage. More specifically, Bain found that companies that reduce customer defections by 5% can boost profits from 25% to 85%.*

As customer retention goes up, marketing costs go down. Moreover, loyal customers frequently bring in new business. The role of the customer as salesperson is especially important in the case of complex products. Buying a telecommunications system that will be at the heart of a business is a major risk. Prospects are filled with worries: Will the dealer provide prompt service? Can the system be expanded later? Will the dealer go out of business? To get reliable answers, prospects tend to rely on friends and colleagues rather than on salespersons or brochures.

The true cost of losing a customer is the amount that person could have spent while involved in a business relationship with the company over a lifetime. The bitter and enduring memories created by a bad buying experience are illustrated by the problems currently facing Detroit.

In 1980, according to a J.D. Power and Associates survey, the owners of General Motors, Ford, and Chrysler automobiles recorded three times the number of problems with cars 90 days out of the showroom than did owners of Japanese automobiles. By 1990, US manufacturers had trimmed the quality gap to 25%. Yet, during the same decade, the Japanese market share rose eight points.†

A plan to foil defectors

Here are four steps that a company should consider in designing a successful customer retention strategy. These steps integrate concepts from marketing and quality management and apply them to the challenge of keeping customers.

Measure customer retention

In sports, even in individual events like the long jump, it is essential to keep score. Without measurement, there is no impetus to do better, no records to break. It's the same in business. Nothing is real unless it gets measured.

If customer retention is not measured, it will not be managed. Unfortunately, it is easy to calculate measures of customer retention, since only internal file data is required for the calculations.

The crude retention rate measures the absolute percentage of customers that are retained. If the number of customers drops from 500 to 475, the crude rate is 95%. The crude rate treats every customer loss as equivalent. The weighted retention rate resolves this by weighting customers by the amount they buy. If the 25 defecting customers had unit purchases that were double the average, the weighted rate is 90%.

If customers source from multiple vendors, high retention rates can mask a problem. For example, when an airline decided to split an order between Boeing 767s and Airbus Industrie A-300s, Boeing retained a customer, but on a shared basis. To reflect multiple sourcing, a customer penetration index can be calculated by evaluating whether the retained customers are growing as fast as market-unit sales. The differences reflect changes in customer penetration.

Interview former customers

Many companies write off customers who are definitely lost; this is a mistake. One can learn a great deal by talking to former customers; either directly or through a consultant. There is no need to guess why customers leave when you can ask them. The information they provide is likely to be more specific and actionable than usual market research.

Customers defect for various reasons, and not all of them are preventable. Some defections result from forces that are external to the business. Other defections can be prevented if corrective actions are taken or new strategies are adopted. Consider these six types of defectors.

● Price defectors are customers who switch to a low-priced competitor. For example, low price was the sole attraction of People Express, the discount airline started by Donald Burr in 1981. Passengers could fly between Boston and New York (Newark NJ, actually) for about half the fare charged on the Eastern shuttle. Bargains like this were compellingly attractive to tourists, students, and other discretionary travelers. By 1984, People had become the fastest-growing airline in the history of aviation.

● Product defectors are customers who switch to a competitor that offers a superior product. This type of defection can be irreversible. A customer who is lost because of price can be ‘bought back’, but it is almost impossible to get a customer back who has switched to a competitor that is perceived as offering a better product.

● Service defectors are customers who leave because of poor service. For example, within a few years, customers of People Express began to leave because of poor service, which included lost bags, scrambled reservations, overbooking and delayed flights. The exodus accelerated once the major carriers used their computer systems to selectively match People’s low prices (e.g., American Airlines offered an Ultimate Super Fare).

By 1986, the party was over for People Express. Declining load factors and negative cash flows forced a sellout to Continental Airlines.

"In an ironic footnote, Donald Burr was again working for his old boss, Frank Lorenzo, a man he had called Darth Vader.

● Market defectors are customers who are lost, but not to a competitor. The customer may go out of business or move out of the market area. During the early 1980s, for example, companies that sold equipment to oil drillers and explorers lost many of their customers when oil prices dropped sharply and customers filed for bankruptcy.

● Technological defectors are customers who convert to a product offered by companies from outside the industry. During the 1980s, Wang Lab’s customers converted en masse from dedicated word processors to multipurpose personal computers. Wang could have prevented these defections, but only by embracing the new technology. Wang did eventually introduce a personal computer, but never marketed it with any seriousness. It was too little and too late.

● Organizational defectors are customers who are lost because of internal or external political considerations. For example, Boeing frequently runs into political problems when selling to state-owned airlines in the developing world. Boeing claims that many of these airlines buy Airbus equipment because they are told that the aid they receive from European governments may be contingent on their willingness to buy from Airbus.

Analyze complaint and service data

It is natural to regard complaints as a nuisance and an irritant—an unpleasant side effect of doing business. However, complaint data can be a gold mine for the analyst who wants to identify problems that cause customer defections. After all, for every customer who complains, there are possibly 10 others who did not voice their complaints. Listening and acting on these grievances can help retain not only the customers who complain, but, more important, those who did not.

The introduction of toll-free complaint lines has increased the amount of complaint data available for analysis. In 1977, Procter & Gamble became the first company to print a toll-free telephone number on all its packages. Doing this did not reduce the volume of mail P&G received, and the net result was an increase in the number of customer contacts. To enable a meaningful statistical analysis, complaints must be classified by problem, product model, product year, and dealer; the product’s registration number should also be noted.

Complaint data must be statistically analyzed. The analysis must go beyond the computation of means and variances. Individual elements must be plotted to identify patterns in the data as well as elements that lie outside the normal expected range. Without statistical methods, attempts to improve a process are hit or miss.

As emphasized by W. Edwards Deming, most problems result from systemic factors such as faulty design, poor supervision, and machines out of order. Complaint analysis may reveal that a particular model or factory account for a disproportionate share of complaints This indicates that the problem is systemic and can be eliminated by management action

Some systemic problems can be eliminated by product redesign For example, Polaroid has used complaint information to make its cameras easy to use On an early model, Polaroid received thousands of calls about torn pictures, customers could not pull the film out without tearing the prints In the next model, Polaroid built in an automatic ejection feature for the film.

Polaroid also received calls complaining that the camera did not work When callers were asked if they had checked the battery, most replied that they did not know the camera contained a battery To handle this problem, Polaroid decided to locate the battery in the film pack so that the battery was changed along with the pack

The need for complaint analysis has been recognized by the judges of the Malcolm Baldrige National Quality Award Baldrige Award judges not only examine whether contestants resolve complaints promptly, but also how they analyze complaints and translate the findings into improvements

Service data can be helpful in trying to understand why customers defect In particular, if certain service problems keep recurring, this suggests that the cause is systemic Some products, such as an automobile, need routine and emergency service if they are to operate at peak efficiency For other products, service may be as simple as teaching customers how to use the product

For example, software firms have set up pay-for-service lines where registered customers can receive advice on how to resolve a particular problem or perform a particular application The callers are often sophisticated users of the software who have a problem that their colleagues are unable to answer By analyzing the calls, a company can identify attractive new features or insert helpful suggestions into its user manual

Service data differs from complaint data. The complainer is an aggrieved individual, with a problem that may be trivial or extreme. The person who needs service is a customer with a standard, technical problem that demands and gets actual attention. Because service data differs from complaint data, its analysis may offer new insights into systemic problems

Complaint and service data is inherently useful; if such data is not being used, this suggests poor statistical analysis or reporting Few companies use statistics effectively, a point made by Deming in his book Quality, Productivity, and Competitive Position. To quote him 'No resource in any company is scarcer than statistical knowledge and ability No source of knowledge can contribute more to improved productivity, and competitiveness

In the context of reporting complaint data, the most common mistake reported is to prepare a single, multipurpose report. Senior managers will not read a thick report, they will find most of the information irrelevant.

A series of reports must be prepared and at least one of them should highlight possible corrective actions.

Identify switching barriers

A company that limits itself to analyzing defections and complaints is backfilling—identifying problems that need to be corrected. But a good retention strategy must move beyond problem resolution. It should identify barriers that will prevent a customer from switching to a competitor, even one who is perceived as offering a better product at a lower price.

Lotus Development Corp., for example, sells against competitors that offer software that is cheaper and in some ways more technically advanced. Yet Lotus still dominates the market. There is a Lotus infrastructure consisting of millions of users, scores of applications and macros, and many special-purpose user groups. Hidden costs associated with a switch from Lotus far exceed the direct savings realized by buying the cheaper software.

To identify switching barriers, look outside your own industry for the best demonstrated practices. If you borrow a practice that is farthest afield from your own industry, your chances of surprising the competition are better. A borrowed practice will, of course, need to be modified to fit your customers' needs.

Electronic data interchange (EDI) is a technological example of a switching barrier. Department stores have traditionally been the most fickle of buyers. In the past, they would readily grant shelf space to a new vendor with a trendy look or a big price discount, but less so today.

Vendors with an EDI link enjoy a protected status. Under EDI, the vendor and vendor share data. The vendor can look at a terminal, see how many of his items are left in the department store, and ship more product. The result is that the department store carries minimum inventory. The reward is a higher level of service to the vendor.

Strategic bundling also can create a barrier to defections. A bundle is a group of products or services offered as a single cost-saving and convenient package. A banking bundle, for example, includes checking and savings accounts, a credit card, a preferred rate on loans, and a special cash flow statement. A customer who buys a bundle is less likely to defect if someone offers a better deal on one of the items in the bundle.

Paradoxically, the ultimate barrier to competition may be a new twist on that old standby—account management. Many companies use the Willy Loman approach, where Willy deals with the buyer or some other middle manager. This relationship works until the buyer or Willy moves on to greener pastures or alienates the contact at the account. If the new model, a team approach is used to forge a bond that lasts long after the key person on the sales force is the key contact in the relationship.

The account team may be headed by the CEO. Typically, CEO efforts are limited to talking with fellow CEOs to forge companywide programs. But the involvement can go beyond the ceremonial.

At Xerox, CEO Paul Allaire personally handles six of the copier company's largest accounts. At Bose Corp., founder Amar Bose gets directly involved in opening markets. He visits Japan at least twice a year, which may explain in part why Bose is one of the largest sellers of high-performance loudspeakers in Japan.

Team account management is an all-hands-on proposition. Even the clerical staff should get involved. Nothing can be more frustrating to a customer than a conflict with an anonymous clerk at the billing or shipping department.

I recently surveyed two corporate subsidiaries, both of which were using identical service systems. Yet customers rated one subsidiary higher. The reason was the person who managed customer service at the better subsidiary. She had been with the company for 20 years and was on a first-name basis with customers, many of whom she had met at trade shows.

To companies that are financially strapped, installing a free terminal in a customer’s office or sending a clerical supervisor to a trade show may seem like an unwarranted extravagance. However, creating switching barriers requires a willingness to spend, to experiment, and to break with industry tradition. To the extent that customer retention actually improves, the expenditures are a justifiable investment. There are few things that are more closely associated with superior business performance than a high rate of customer retention.

    title: "DESIGNING A CUSTOMER RETENTION PLAN",
    content: `Glenn DeSouza is President of Strategic Quality Systems Inc., a consulting firm based in Belmont, Massachusetts. He is also a Visiting Assistant Professor at the University of Massachusetts at Boston.
This article emphasizes the need to develop a customer retention plan. It provides a simple four-step process to design a customer retention strategy, suggests a classification for 'type of defector' and emphasizes the need for benchmarking demonstrated best practice to identify ways to build switching costs and develop approaches to yield higher levels of customer retention.

Nothing may seem more obvious than the need to keep customers coming back. Yet, customer retention is either overlooked or devalued when it comes to strategy development. Any marketing manager can provide you with a market share estimate, but ask for the customer retention rate and you may well get a blank stare.
Buck Rodgers, who headed worldwide marketing for IBM as the company's sales grew from $10 billion to $50 billion, speaks forcefully about the importance of customer retention in his book, The IBM Way: "It seems to me," observes Rodgers, "that most companies are a lot better at prospecting for new customers than maintaining their customer list. As far as I'm concerned, customer maintenance is imperative to doing business... Someone once said I behaved as if every IBM customer were on the verge of leaving and that I'd do anything to keep them from bolting."

It pays to be obsessive about retaining customers. A cost study of service companies by Bain & Co. found that customer retention has a more powerful effect on profits than market share, scale economies, and other variables that are commonly associated with competitive advantage. More specifically, Bain found that companies that reduce customer defections by 5% can boost profits from 25% to 85%.*

As customer retention goes up, marketing costs go down. Moreover, loyal customers frequently bring in new business. The role of the customer as salesperson is especially important in the case of complex products. Buying a telecommunications system that will be at the heart of a business is a major risk. Prospects are filled with worries: Will the dealer provide prompt service? Can the system be expanded later? Will the dealer go out of business? To get reliable answers, prospects tend to rely on friends and colleagues rather than on salespersons or brochures.

The true cost of losing a customer is the amount that person could have spent while involved in a business relationship with the company over a lifetime. The bitter and enduring memories created by a bad buying experience are illustrated by the problems currently facing Detroit.

In 1980, according to a J.D. Power and Associates survey, the owners of General Motors, Ford, and Chrysler automobiles recorded three times the number of problems with cars 90 days out of the showroom than did owners of Japanese automobiles. By 1990, US manufacturers had trimmed the quality gap to 25%. Yet, during the same decade, the Japanese market share rose eight points.†

A plan to foil defectors

Here are four steps that a company should consider in designing a successful customer retention strategy. These steps integrate concepts from marketing and quality management and apply them to the challenge of keeping customers.

Measure customer retention

In sports, even in individual events like the long jump, it is essential to keep score. Without measurement, there is no impetus to do better, no records to break. It's the same in business. Nothing is real unless it gets measured.

If customer retention is not measured, it will not be managed. Unfortunately, it is easy to calculate measures of customer retention, since only internal file data is required for the calculations.

The crude retention rate measures the absolute percentage of customers that are retained. If the number of customers drops from 500 to 475, the crude rate is 95%. The crude rate treats every customer loss as equivalent. The weighted retention rate resolves this by weighting customers by the amount they buy. If the 25 defecting customers had unit purchases that were double the average, the weighted rate is 90%.

If customers source from multiple vendors, high retention rates can mask a problem. For example, when an airline decided to split an order between Boeing 767s and Airbus Industrie A-300s, Boeing retained a customer, but on a shared basis. To reflect multiple sourcing, a customer penetration index can be calculated by evaluating whether the retained customers are growing as fast as market-unit sales. The differences reflect changes in customer penetration.

Interview former customers

Many companies write off customers who are definitely lost; this is a mistake. One can learn a great deal by talking to former customers; either directly or through a consultant. There is no need to guess why customers leave when you can ask them. The information they provide is likely to be more specific and actionable than usual market research.

Customers defect for various reasons, and not all of them are preventable. Some defections result from forces that are external to the business. Other defections can be prevented if corrective actions are taken or new strategies are adopted. Consider these six types of defectors.

● Price defectors are customers who switch to a low-priced competitor. For example, low price was the sole attraction of People Express, the discount airline started by Donald Burr in 1981. Passengers could fly between Boston and New York (Newark NJ, actually) for about half the fare charged on the Eastern shuttle. Bargains like this were compellingly attractive to tourists, students, and other discretionary travelers. By 1984, People had become the fastest-growing airline in the history of aviation.

● Product defectors are customers who switch to a competitor that offers a superior product. This type of defection can be irreversible. A customer who is lost because of price can be ‘bought back’, but it is almost impossible to get a customer back who has switched to a competitor that is perceived as offering a better product.

● Service defectors are customers who leave because of poor service. For example, within a few years, customers of People Express began to leave because of poor service, which included lost bags, scrambled reservations, overbooking and delayed flights. The exodus accelerated once the major carriers used their computer systems to selectively match People’s low prices (e.g., American Airlines offered an Ultimate Super Fare).

By 1986, the party was over for People Express. Declining load factors and negative cash flows forced a sellout to Continental Airlines.

"In an ironic footnote, Donald Burr was again working for his old boss, Frank Lorenzo, a man he had called Darth Vader.

● Market defectors are customers who are lost, but not to a competitor. The customer may go out of business or move out of the market area. During the early 1980s, for example, companies that sold equipment to oil drillers and explorers lost many of their customers when oil prices dropped sharply and customers filed for bankruptcy.

● Technological defectors are customers who convert to a product offered by companies from outside the industry. During the 1980s, Wang Lab’s customers converted en masse from dedicated word processors to multipurpose personal computers. Wang could have prevented these defections, but only by embracing the new technology. Wang did eventually introduce a personal computer, but never marketed it with any seriousness. It was too little and too late.

● Organizational defectors are customers who are lost because of internal or external political considerations. For example, Boeing frequently runs into political problems when selling to state-owned airlines in the developing world. Boeing claims that many of these airlines buy Airbus equipment because they are told that the aid they receive from European governments may be contingent on their willingness to buy from Airbus.

Analyze complaint and service data

It is natural to regard complaints as a nuisance and an irritant—an unpleasant side effect of doing business. However, complaint data can be a gold mine for the analyst who wants to identify problems that cause customer defections. After all, for every customer who complains, there are possibly 10 others who did not voice their complaints. Listening and acting on these grievances can help retain not only the customers who complain, but, more important, those who did not.

The introduction of toll-free complaint lines has increased the amount of complaint data available for analysis. In 1977, Procter & Gamble became the first company to print a toll-free telephone number on all its packages. Doing this did not reduce the volume of mail P&G received, and the net result was an increase in the number of customer contacts. To enable a meaningful statistical analysis, complaints must be classified by problem, product model, product year, and dealer; the product’s registration number should also be noted.

Complaint data must be statistically analyzed. The analysis must go beyond the computation of means and variances. Individual elements must be plotted to identify patterns in the data as well as elements that lie outside the normal expected range. Without statistical methods, attempts to improve a process are hit or miss.

As emphasized by W. Edwards Deming, most problems result from systemic factors such as faulty design, poor supervision, and machines out of order. Complaint analysis may reveal that a particular model or factory account for a disproportionate share of complaints This indicates that the problem is systemic and can be eliminated by management action

Some systemic problems can be eliminated by product redesign For example, Polaroid has used complaint information to make its cameras easy to use On an early model, Polaroid received thousands of calls about torn pictures, customers could not pull the film out without tearing the prints In the next model, Polaroid built in an automatic ejection feature for the film.

Polaroid also received calls complaining that the camera did not work When callers were asked if they had checked the battery, most replied that they did not know the camera contained a battery To handle this problem, Polaroid decided to locate the battery in the film pack so that the battery was changed along with the pack

The need for complaint analysis has been recognized by the judges of the Malcolm Baldrige National Quality Award Baldrige Award judges not only examine whether contestants resolve complaints promptly, but also how they analyze complaints and translate the findings into improvements

Service data can be helpful in trying to understand why customers defect In particular, if certain service problems keep recurring, this suggests that the cause is systemic Some products, such as an automobile, need routine and emergency service if they are to operate at peak efficiency For other products, service may be as simple as teaching customers how to use the product

For example, software firms have set up pay-for-service lines where registered customers can receive advice on how to resolve a particular problem or perform a particular application The callers are often sophisticated users of the software who have a problem that their colleagues are unable to answer By analyzing the calls, a company can identify attractive new features or insert helpful suggestions into its user manual

Service data differs from complaint data. The complainer is an aggrieved individual, with a problem that may be trivial or extreme. The person who needs service is a customer with a standard, technical problem that demands and gets actual attention. Because service data differs from complaint data, its analysis may offer new insights into systemic problems

Complaint and service data is inherently useful; if such data is not being used, this suggests poor statistical analysis or reporting Few companies use statistics effectively, a point made by Deming in his book Quality, Productivity, and Competitive Position. To quote him 'No resource in any company is scarcer than statistical knowledge and ability No source of knowledge can contribute more to improved productivity, and competitiveness

In the context of reporting complaint data, the most common mistake reported is to prepare a single, multipurpose report. Senior managers will not read a thick report, they will find most of the information irrelevant.

A series of reports must be prepared and at least one of them should highlight possible corrective actions.

Identify switching barriers

A company that limits itself to analyzing defections and complaints is backfilling—identifying problems that need to be corrected. But a good retention strategy must move beyond problem resolution. It should identify barriers that will prevent a customer from switching to a competitor, even one who is perceived as offering a better product at a lower price.

Lotus Development Corp., for example, sells against competitors that offer software that is cheaper and in some ways more technically advanced. Yet Lotus still dominates the market. There is a Lotus infrastructure consisting of millions of users, scores of applications and macros, and many special-purpose user groups. Hidden costs associated with a switch from Lotus far exceed the direct savings realized by buying the cheaper software.

To identify switching barriers, look outside your own industry for the best demonstrated practices. If you borrow a practice that is farthest afield from your own industry, your chances of surprising the competition are better. A borrowed practice will, of course, need to be modified to fit your customers' needs.

Electronic data interchange (EDI) is a technological example of a switching barrier. Department stores have traditionally been the most fickle of buyers. In the past, they would readily grant shelf space to a new vendor with a trendy look or a big price discount, but less so today.

Vendors with an EDI link enjoy a protected status. Under EDI, the vendor and vendor share data. The vendor can look at a terminal, see how many of his items are left in the department store, and ship more product. The result is that the department store carries minimum inventory. The reward is a higher level of service to the vendor.

Strategic bundling also can create a barrier to defections. A bundle is a group of products or services offered as a single cost-saving and convenient package. A banking bundle, for example, includes checking and savings accounts, a credit card, a preferred rate on loans, and a special cash flow statement. A customer who buys a bundle is less likely to defect if someone offers a better deal on one of the items in the bundle.

Paradoxically, the ultimate barrier to competition may be a new twist on that old standby—account management. Many companies use the Willy Loman approach, where Willy deals with the buyer or some other middle manager. This relationship works until the buyer or Willy moves on to greener pastures or alienates the contact at the account. If the new model, a team approach is used to forge a bond that lasts long after the key person on the sales force is the key contact in the relationship.

The account team may be headed by the CEO. Typically, CEO efforts are limited to talking with fellow CEOs to forge companywide programs. But the involvement can go beyond the ceremonial.

At Xerox, CEO Paul Allaire personally handles six of the copier company's largest accounts. At Bose Corp., founder Amar Bose gets directly involved in opening markets. He visits Japan at least twice a year, which may explain in part why Bose is one of the largest sellers of high-performance loudspeakers in Japan.

Team account management is an all-hands-on proposition. Even the clerical staff should get involved. Nothing can be more frustrating to a customer than a conflict with an anonymous clerk at the billing or shipping department.

I recently surveyed two corporate subsidiaries, both of which were using identical service systems. Yet customers rated one subsidiary higher. The reason was the person who managed customer service at the better subsidiary. She had been with the company for 20 years and was on a first-name basis with customers, many of whom she had met at trade shows.

To companies that are financially strapped, installing a free terminal in a customer’s office or sending a clerical supervisor to a trade show may seem like an unwarranted extravagance. However, creating switching barriers requires a willingness to spend, to experiment, and to break with industry tradition. To the extent that customer retention actually improves, the expenditures are a justifiable investment. There are few things that are more closely associated with superior business performance than a high rate of customer retention.

    title: "DESIGNING A CUSTOMER RETENTION PLAN",
    content: `Glenn DeSouza is President of Strategic Quality Systems Inc., a consulting firm based in Belmont, Massachusetts. He is also a Visiting Assistant Professor at the University of Massachusetts at Boston.
This article emphasizes the need to develop a customer retention plan. It provides a simple four-step process to design a customer retention strategy, suggests a classification for 'type of defector' and emphasizes the need for benchmarking demonstrated best practice to identify ways to build switching costs and develop approaches to yield higher levels of customer retention.

Nothing may seem more obvious than the need to keep customers coming back. Yet, customer retention is either overlooked or devalued when it comes to strategy development. Any marketing manager can provide you with a market share estimate, but ask for the customer retention rate and you may well get a blank stare.
Buck Rodgers, who headed worldwide marketing for IBM as the company's sales grew from $10 billion to $50 billion, speaks forcefully about the importance of customer retention in his book, The IBM Way: "It seems to me," observes Rodgers, "that most companies are a lot better at prospecting for new customers than maintaining their customer list. As far as I'm concerned, customer maintenance is imperative to doing business... Someone once said I behaved as if every IBM customer were on the verge of leaving and that I'd do anything to keep them from bolting."

It pays to be obsessive about retaining customers. A cost study of service companies by Bain & Co. found that customer retention has a more powerful effect on profits than market share, scale economies, and other variables that are commonly associated with competitive advantage. More specifically, Bain found that companies that reduce customer defections by 5% can boost profits from 25% to 85%.*

As customer retention goes up, marketing costs go down. Moreover, loyal customers frequently bring in new business. The role of the customer as salesperson is especially important in the case of complex products. Buying a telecommunications system that will be at the heart of a business is a major risk. Prospects are filled with worries: Will the dealer provide prompt service? Can the system be expanded later? Will the dealer go out of business? To get reliable answers, prospects tend to rely on friends and colleagues rather than on salespersons or brochures.

The true cost of losing a customer is the amount that person could have spent while involved in a business relationship with the company over a lifetime. The bitter and enduring memories created by a bad buying experience are illustrated by the problems currently facing Detroit.

In 1980, according to a J.D. Power and Associates survey, the owners of General Motors, Ford, and Chrysler automobiles recorded three times the number of problems with cars 90 days out of the showroom than did owners of Japanese automobiles. By 1990, US manufacturers had trimmed the quality gap to 25%. Yet, during the same decade, the Japanese market share rose eight points.†

A plan to foil defectors

Here are four steps that a company should consider in designing a successful customer retention strategy. These steps integrate concepts from marketing and quality management and apply them to the challenge of keeping customers.

Measure customer retention

In sports, even in individual events like the long jump, it is essential to keep score. Without measurement, there is no impetus to do better, no records to break. It's the same in business. Nothing is real unless it gets measured.

If customer retention is not measured, it will not be managed. Unfortunately, it is easy to calculate measures of customer retention, since only internal file data is required for the calculations.

The crude retention rate measures the absolute percentage of customers that are retained. If the number of customers drops from 500 to 475, the crude rate is 95%. The crude rate treats every customer loss as equivalent. The weighted retention rate resolves this by weighting customers by the amount they buy. If the 25 defecting customers had unit purchases that were double the average, the weighted rate is 90%.

If customers source from multiple vendors, high retention rates can mask a problem. For example, when an airline decided to split an order between Boeing 767s and Airbus Industrie A-300s, Boeing retained a customer, but on a shared basis. To reflect multiple sourcing, a customer penetration index can be calculated by evaluating whether the retained customers are growing as fast as market-unit sales. The differences reflect changes in customer penetration.

Interview former customers

Many companies write off customers who are definitely lost; this is a mistake. One can learn a great deal by talking to former customers; either directly or through a consultant. There is no need to guess why customers leave when you can ask them. The information they provide is likely to be more specific and actionable than usual market research.

Customers defect for various reasons, and not all of them are preventable. Some defections result from forces that are external to the business. Other defections can be prevented if corrective actions are taken or new strategies are adopted. Consider these six types of defectors.

● Price defectors are customers who switch to a low-priced competitor. For example, low price was the sole attraction of People Express, the discount airline started by Donald Burr in 1981. Passengers could fly between Boston and New York (Newark NJ, actually) for about half the fare charged on the Eastern shuttle. Bargains like this were compellingly attractive to tourists, students, and other discretionary travelers. By 1984, People had become the fastest-growing airline in the history of aviation.

● Product defectors are customers who switch to a competitor that offers a superior product. This type of defection can be irreversible. A customer who is lost because of price can be ‘bought back’, but it is almost impossible to get a customer back who has switched to a competitor that is perceived as offering a better product.

● Service defectors are customers who leave because of poor service. For example, within a few years, customers of People Express began to leave because of poor service, which included lost bags, scrambled reservations, overbooking and delayed flights. The exodus accelerated once the major carriers used their computer systems to selectively match People’s low prices (e.g., American Airlines offered an Ultimate Super Fare).

By 1986, the party was over for People Express. Declining load factors and negative cash flows forced a sellout to Continental Airlines.

"In an ironic footnote, Donald Burr was again working for his old boss, Frank Lorenzo, a man he had called Darth Vader.

● Market defectors are customers who are lost, but not to a competitor. The customer may go out of business or move out of the market area. During the early 1980s, for example, companies that sold equipment to oil drillers and explorers lost many of their customers when oil prices dropped sharply and customers filed for bankruptcy.

● Technological defectors are customers who convert to a product offered by companies from outside the industry. During the 1980s, Wang Lab’s customers converted en masse from dedicated word processors to multipurpose personal computers. Wang could have prevented these defections, but only by embracing the new technology. Wang did eventually introduce a personal computer, but never marketed it with any seriousness. It was too little and too late.

● Organizational defectors are customers who are lost because of internal or external political considerations. For example, Boeing frequently runs into political problems when selling to state-owned airlines in the developing world. Boeing claims that many of these airlines buy Airbus equipment because they are told that the aid they receive from European governments may be contingent on their willingness to buy from Airbus.

Analyze complaint and service data

It is natural to regard complaints as a nuisance and an irritant—an unpleasant side effect of doing business. However, complaint data can be a gold mine for the analyst who wants to identify problems that cause customer defections. After all, for every customer who complains, there are possibly 10 others who did not voice their complaints. Listening and acting on these grievances can help retain not only the customers who complain, but, more important, those who did not.

The introduction of toll-free complaint lines has increased the amount of complaint data available for analysis. In 1977, Procter & Gamble became the first company to print a toll-free telephone number on all its packages. Doing this did not reduce the volume of mail P&G received, and the net result was an increase in the number of customer contacts. To enable a meaningful statistical analysis, complaints must be classified by problem, product model, product year, and dealer; the product’s registration number should also be noted.

Complaint data must be statistically analyzed. The analysis must go beyond the computation of means and variances. Individual elements must be plotted to identify patterns in the data as well as elements that lie outside the normal expected range. Without statistical methods, attempts to improve a process are hit or miss.

As emphasized by W. Edwards Deming, most problems result from systemic factors such as faulty design, poor supervision, and machines out of order. Complaint analysis may reveal that a particular model or factory account for a disproportionate share of complaints This indicates that the problem is systemic and can be eliminated by management action

Some systemic problems can be eliminated by product redesign For example, Polaroid has used complaint information to make its cameras easy to use On an early model, Polaroid received thousands of calls about torn pictures, customers could not pull the film out without tearing the prints In the next model, Polaroid built in an automatic ejection feature for the film.

Polaroid also received calls complaining that the camera did not work When callers were asked if they had checked the battery, most replied that they did not know the camera contained a battery To handle this problem, Polaroid decided to locate the battery in the film pack so that the battery was changed along with the pack

The need for complaint analysis has been recognized by the judges of the Malcolm Baldrige National Quality Award Baldrige Award judges not only examine whether contestants resolve complaints promptly, but also how they analyze complaints and translate the findings into improvements

Service data can be helpful in trying to understand why customers defect In particular, if certain service problems keep recurring, this suggests that the cause is systemic Some products, such as an automobile, need routine and emergency service if they are to operate at peak efficiency For other products, service may be as simple as teaching customers how to use the product

For example, software firms have set up pay-for-service lines where registered customers can receive advice on how to resolve a particular problem or perform a particular application The callers are often sophisticated users of the software who have a problem that their colleagues are unable to answer By analyzing the calls, a company can identify attractive new features or insert helpful suggestions into its user manual

Service data differs from complaint data. The complainer is an aggrieved individual, with a problem that may be trivial or extreme. The person who needs service is a customer with a standard, technical problem that demands and gets actual attention. Because service data differs from complaint data, its analysis may offer new insights into systemic problems

Complaint and service data is inherently useful; if such data is not being used, this suggests poor statistical analysis or reporting Few companies use statistics effectively, a point made by Deming in his book Quality, Productivity, and Competitive Position. To quote him 'No resource in any company is scarcer than statistical knowledge and ability No source of knowledge can contribute more to improved productivity, and competitiveness

In the context of reporting complaint data, the most common mistake reported is to prepare a single, multipurpose report. Senior managers will not read a thick report, they will find most of the information irrelevant.

A series of reports must be prepared and at least one of them should highlight possible corrective actions.

Identify switching barriers

A company that limits itself to analyzing defections and complaints is backfilling—identifying problems that need to be corrected. But a good retention strategy must move beyond problem resolution. It should identify barriers that will prevent a customer from switching to a competitor, even one who is perceived as offering a better product at a lower price.

Lotus Development Corp., for example, sells against competitors that offer software that is cheaper and in some ways more technically advanced. Yet Lotus still dominates the market. There is a Lotus infrastructure consisting of millions of users, scores of applications and macros, and many special-purpose user groups. Hidden costs associated with a switch from Lotus far exceed the direct savings realized by buying the cheaper software.

To identify switching barriers, look outside your own industry for the best demonstrated practices. If you borrow a practice that is farthest afield from your own industry, your chances of surprising the competition are better. A borrowed practice will, of course, need to be modified to fit your customers' needs.

Electronic data interchange (EDI) is a technological example of a switching barrier. Department stores have traditionally been the most fickle of buyers. In the past, they would readily grant shelf space to a new vendor with a trendy look or a big price discount, but less so today.

Vendors with an EDI link enjoy a protected status. Under EDI, the vendor and vendor share data. The vendor can look at a terminal, see how many of his items are left in the department store, and ship more product. The result is that the department store carries minimum inventory. The reward is a higher level of service to the vendor.

Strategic bundling also can create a barrier to defections. A bundle is a group of products or services offered as a single cost-saving and convenient package. A banking bundle, for example, includes checking and savings accounts, a credit card, a preferred rate on loans, and a special cash flow statement. A customer who buys a bundle is less likely to defect if someone offers a better deal on one of the items in the bundle.

Paradoxically, the ultimate barrier to competition may be a new twist on that old standby—account management. Many companies use the Willy Loman approach, where Willy deals with the buyer or some other middle manager. This relationship works until the buyer or Willy moves on to greener pastures or alienates the contact at the account. If the new model, a team approach is used to forge a bond that lasts long after the key person on the sales force is the key contact in the relationship.

The account team may be headed by the CEO. Typically, CEO efforts are limited to talking with fellow CEOs to forge companywide programs. But the involvement can go beyond the ceremonial.

At Xerox, CEO Paul Allaire personally handles six of the copier company's largest accounts. At Bose Corp., founder Amar Bose gets directly involved in opening markets. He visits Japan at least twice a year, which may explain in part why Bose is one of the largest sellers of high-performance loudspeakers in Japan.

Team account management is an all-hands-on proposition. Even the clerical staff should get involved. Nothing can be more frustrating to a customer than a conflict with an anonymous clerk at the billing or shipping department.

I recently surveyed two corporate subsidiaries, both of which were using identical service systems. Yet customers rated one subsidiary higher. The reason was the person who managed customer service at the better subsidiary. She had been with the company for 20 years and was on a first-name basis with customers, many of whom she had met at trade shows.

To companies that are financially strapped, installing a free terminal in a customer’s office or sending a clerical supervisor to a trade show may seem like an unwarranted extravagance. However, creating switching barriers requires a willingness to spend, to experiment, and to break with industry tradition. To the extent that customer retention actually improves, the expenditures are a justifiable investment. There are few things that are more closely associated with superior business performance than a high rate of customer retention.

    title: "DESIGNING A CUSTOMER RETENTION PLAN",
    content: `Glenn DeSouza is President of Strategic Quality Systems Inc., a consulting firm based in Belmont, Massachusetts. He is also a Visiting Assistant Professor at the University of Massachusetts at Boston.
This article emphasizes the need to develop a customer retention plan. It provides a simple four-step process to design a customer retention strategy, suggests a classification for 'type of defector' and emphasizes the need for benchmarking demonstrated best practice to identify ways to build switching costs and develop approaches to yield higher levels of customer retention.

Nothing may seem more obvious than the need to keep customers coming back. Yet, customer retention is either overlooked or devalued when it comes to strategy development. Any marketing manager can provide you with a market share estimate, but ask for the customer retention rate and you may well get a blank stare.
Buck Rodgers, who headed worldwide marketing for IBM as the company's sales grew from $10 billion to $50 billion, speaks forcefully about the importance of customer retention in his book, The IBM Way: "It seems to me," observes Rodgers, "that most companies are a lot better at prospecting for new customers than maintaining their customer list. As far as I'm concerned, customer maintenance is imperative to doing business... Someone once said I behaved as if every IBM customer were on the verge of leaving and that I'd do anything to keep them from bolting."

It pays to be obsessive about retaining customers. A cost study of service companies by Bain & Co. found that customer retention has a more powerful effect on profits than market share, scale economies, and other variables that are commonly associated with competitive advantage. More specifically, Bain found that companies that reduce customer defections by 5% can boost profits from 25% to 85%.*

As customer retention goes up, marketing costs go down. Moreover, loyal customers frequently bring in new business. The role of the customer as salesperson is especially important in the case of complex products. Buying a telecommunications system that will be at the heart of a business is a major risk. Prospects are filled with worries: Will the dealer provide prompt service? Can the system be expanded later? Will the dealer go out of business? To get reliable answers, prospects tend to rely on friends and colleagues rather than on salespersons or brochures.

The true cost of losing a customer is the amount that person could have spent while involved in a business relationship with the company over a lifetime. The bitter and enduring memories created by a bad buying experience are illustrated by the problems currently facing Detroit.

In 1980, according to a J.D. Power and Associates survey, the owners of General Motors, Ford, and Chrysler automobiles recorded three times the number of problems with cars 90 days out of the showroom than did owners of Japanese automobiles. By 1990, US manufacturers had trimmed the quality gap to 25%. Yet, during the same decade, the Japanese market share rose eight points.†

A plan to foil defectors

Here are four steps that a company should consider in designing a successful customer retention strategy. These steps integrate concepts from marketing and quality management and apply them to the challenge of keeping customers.

Measure customer retention

In sports, even in individual events like the long jump, it is essential to keep score. Without measurement, there is no impetus to do better, no records to break. It's the same in business. Nothing is real unless it gets measured.

If customer retention is not measured, it will not be managed. Unfortunately, it is easy to calculate measures of customer retention, since only internal file data is required for the calculations.

The crude retention rate measures the absolute percentage of customers that are retained. If the number of customers drops from 500 to 475, the crude rate is 95%. The crude rate treats every customer loss as equivalent. The weighted retention rate resolves this by weighting customers by the amount they buy. If the 25 defecting customers had unit purchases that were double the average, the weighted rate is 90%.

If customers source from multiple vendors, high retention rates can mask a problem. For example, when an airline decided to split an order between Boeing 767s and Airbus Industrie A-300s, Boeing retained a customer, but on a shared basis. To reflect multiple sourcing, a customer penetration index can be calculated by evaluating whether the retained customers are growing as fast as market-unit sales. The differences reflect changes in customer penetration.

Interview former customers

Many companies write off customers who are definitely lost; this is a mistake. One can learn a great deal by talking to former customers; either directly or through a consultant. There is no need to guess why customers leave when you can ask them. The information they provide is likely to be more specific and actionable than usual market research.

Customers defect for various reasons, and not all of them are preventable. Some defections result from forces that are external to the business. Other defections can be prevented if corrective actions are taken or new strategies are adopted. Consider these six types of defectors.

● Price defectors are customers who switch to a low-priced competitor. For example, low price was the sole attraction of People Express, the discount airline started by Donald Burr in 1981. Passengers could fly between Boston and New York (Newark NJ, actually) for about half the fare charged on the Eastern shuttle. Bargains like this were compellingly attractive to tourists, students, and other discretionary travelers. By 1984, People had become the fastest-growing airline in the history of aviation.

● Product defectors are customers who switch to a competitor that offers a superior product. This type of defection can be irreversible. A customer who is lost because of price can be ‘bought back’, but it is almost impossible to get a customer back who has switched to a competitor that is perceived as offering a better product.

● Service defectors are customers who leave because of poor service. For example, within a few years, customers of People Express began to leave because of poor service, which included lost bags, scrambled reservations, overbooking and delayed flights. The exodus accelerated once the major carriers used their computer systems to selectively match People’s low prices (e.g., American Airlines offered an Ultimate Super Fare).

By 1986, the party was over for People Express. Declining load factors and negative cash flows forced a sellout to Continental Airlines.

"In an ironic footnote, Donald Burr was again working for his old boss, Frank Lorenzo, a man he had called Darth Vader.

● Market defectors are customers who are lost, but not to a competitor. The customer may go out of business or move out of the market area. During the early 1980s, for example, companies that sold equipment to oil drillers and explorers lost many of their customers when oil prices dropped sharply and customers filed for bankruptcy.

● Technological defectors are customers who convert to a product offered by companies from outside the industry. During the 1980s, Wang Lab’s customers converted en masse from dedicated word processors to multipurpose personal computers. Wang could have prevented these defections, but only by embracing the new technology. Wang did eventually introduce a personal computer, but never marketed it with any seriousness. It was too little and too late.

● Organizational defectors are customers who are lost because of internal or external political considerations. For example, Boeing frequently runs into political problems when selling to state-owned airlines in the developing world. Boeing claims that many of these airlines buy Airbus equipment because they are told that the aid they receive from European governments may be contingent on their willingness to buy from Airbus.

Analyze complaint and service data

It is natural to regard complaints as a nuisance and an irritant—an unpleasant side effect of doing business. However, complaint data can be a gold mine for the analyst who wants to identify problems that cause customer defections. After all, for every customer who complains, there are possibly 10 others who did not voice their complaints. Listening and acting on these grievances can help retain not only the customers who complain, but, more important, those who did not.

The introduction of toll-free complaint lines has increased the amount of complaint data available for analysis. In 1977, Procter & Gamble became the first company to print a toll-free telephone number on all its packages. Doing this did not reduce the volume of mail P&G received, and the net result was an increase in the number of customer contacts. To enable a meaningful statistical analysis, complaints must be classified by problem, product model, product year, and dealer; the product’s registration number should also be noted.

Complaint data must be statistically analyzed. The analysis must go beyond the computation of means and variances. Individual elements must be plotted to identify patterns in the data as well as elements that lie outside the normal expected range. Without statistical methods, attempts to improve a process are hit or miss.

As emphasized by W. Edwards Deming, most problems result from systemic factors such as faulty design, poor supervision, and machines out of order. Complaint analysis may reveal that a particular model or factory account for a disproportionate share of complaints This indicates that the problem is systemic and can be eliminated by management action

Some systemic problems can be eliminated by product redesign For example, Polaroid has used complaint information to make its cameras easy to use On an early model, Polaroid received thousands of calls about torn pictures, customers could not pull the film out without tearing the prints In the next model, Polaroid built in an automatic ejection feature for the film.

Polaroid also received calls complaining that the camera did not work When callers were asked if they had checked the battery, most replied that they did not know the camera contained a battery To handle this problem, Polaroid decided to locate the battery in the film pack so that the battery was changed along with the pack

The need for complaint analysis has been recognized by the judges of the Malcolm Baldrige National Quality Award Baldrige Award judges not only examine whether contestants resolve complaints promptly, but also how they analyze complaints and translate the findings into improvements

Service data can be helpful in trying to understand why customers defect In particular, if certain service problems keep recurring, this suggests that the cause is systemic Some products, such as an automobile, need routine and emergency service if they are to operate at peak efficiency For other products, service may be as simple as teaching customers how to use the product

For example, software firms have set up pay-for-service lines where registered customers can receive advice on how to resolve a particular problem or perform a particular application The callers are often sophisticated users of the software who have a problem that their colleagues are unable to answer By analyzing the calls, a company can identify attractive new features or insert helpful suggestions into its user manual

Service data differs from complaint data. The complainer is an aggrieved individual, with a problem that may be trivial or extreme. The person who needs service is a customer with a standard, technical problem that demands and gets actual attention. Because service data differs from complaint data, its analysis may offer new insights into systemic problems

Complaint and service data is inherently useful; if such data is not being used, this suggests poor statistical analysis or reporting Few companies use statistics effectively, a point made by Deming in his book Quality, Productivity, and Competitive Position. To quote him 'No resource in any company is scarcer than statistical knowledge and ability No source of knowledge can contribute more to improved productivity, and competitiveness

In the context of reporting complaint data, the most common mistake reported is to prepare a single, multipurpose report. Senior managers will not read a thick report, they will find most of the information irrelevant.

A series of reports must be prepared and at least one of them should highlight possible corrective actions.

Identify switching barriers

A company that limits itself to analyzing defections and complaints is backfilling—identifying problems that need to be corrected. But a good retention strategy must move beyond problem resolution. It should identify barriers that will prevent a customer from switching to a competitor, even one who is perceived as offering a better product at a lower price.

Lotus Development Corp., for example, sells against competitors that offer software that is cheaper and in some ways more technically advanced. Yet Lotus still dominates the market. There is a Lotus infrastructure consisting of millions of users, scores of applications and macros, and many special-purpose user groups. Hidden costs associated with a switch from Lotus far exceed the direct savings realized by buying the cheaper software.

To identify switching barriers, look outside your own industry for the best demonstrated practices. If you borrow a practice that is farthest afield from your own industry, your chances of surprising the competition are better. A borrowed practice will, of course, need to be modified to fit your customers' needs.

Electronic data interchange (EDI) is a technological example of a switching barrier. Department stores have traditionally been the most fickle of buyers. In the past, they would readily grant shelf space to a new vendor with a trendy look or a big price discount, but less so today.

Vendors with an EDI link enjoy a protected status. Under EDI, the vendor and vendor share data. The vendor can look at a terminal, see how many of his items are left in the department store, and ship more product. The result is that the department store carries minimum inventory. The reward is a higher level of service to the vendor.

Strategic bundling also can create a barrier to defections. A bundle is a group of products or services offered as a single cost-saving and convenient package. A banking bundle, for example, includes checking and savings accounts, a credit card, a preferred rate on loans, and a special cash flow statement. A customer who buys a bundle is less likely to defect if someone offers a better deal on one of the items in the bundle.

Paradoxically, the ultimate barrier to competition may be a new twist on that old standby—account management. Many companies use the Willy Loman approach, where Willy deals with the buyer or some other middle manager. This relationship works until the buyer or Willy moves on to greener pastures or alienates the contact at the account. If the new model, a team approach is used to forge a bond that lasts long after the key person on the sales force is the key contact in the relationship.

The account team may be headed by the CEO. Typically, CEO efforts are limited to talking with fellow CEOs to forge companywide programs. But the involvement can go beyond the ceremonial.

At Xerox, CEO Paul Allaire personally handles six of the copier company's largest accounts. At Bose Corp., founder Amar Bose gets directly involved in opening markets. He visits Japan at least twice a year, which may explain in part why Bose is one of the largest sellers of high-performance loudspeakers in Japan.

Team account management is an all-hands-on proposition. Even the clerical staff should get involved. Nothing can be more frustrating to a customer than a conflict with an anonymous clerk at the billing or shipping department.

I recently surveyed two corporate subsidiaries, both of which were using identical service systems. Yet customers rated one subsidiary higher. The reason was the person who managed customer service at the better subsidiary. She had been with the company for 20 years and was on a first-name basis with customers, many of whom she had met at trade shows.

To companies that are financially strapped, installing a free terminal in a customer’s office or sending a clerical supervisor to a trade show may seem like an unwarranted extravagance. However, creating switching barriers requires a willingness to spend, to experiment, and to break with industry tradition. To the extent that customer retention actually improves, the expenditures are a justifiable investment. There are few things that are more closely associated with superior business performance than a high rate of customer retention.
